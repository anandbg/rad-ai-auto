## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use @dnd-kit for drag-drop (not react-beautiful-dnd - deprecated)
- Use react-resizable-panels for split pane layout
- Use AI SDK Output.object() with Zod for structured template generation

- Modern blue-purple brand colors for landing page (distinct from app burgundy)
- Playwright MCP browser automation for screenshot capture
- Sharp for PNG to WebP conversion at quality 85

**Issues Resolved:**
